## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are using all the tools GitHub is providing to do security assessments, including third-party tools like Snyk to keep our dependencies up-to-date, security advisories and dependency alerts.

Though, if you find something that is not yet detectable by tools, you can keep in touch with me by writing an email to ghaiklor@gmail.com.
